**Rules (Read this first!)**
This is just a template to help you post a useful issue.  Erase these rules and any irrelevant categories and content as you see fit.

- Only submit issues related to the latest version of the mod for the Minecraft version specified by the template.
- When referring to versions always use the actual version number; never "latest".
- Use a paste site, preferably [Gist](https://gist.github.com) to dump any logs or crash reports.
- Do not open bug reports for add-ons! These should be reported to their respective issue trackers.
- Do not use this template for feature requests, there's a separate template for that.

If you do not follow these basic rules we may well close the issue without explanation.
