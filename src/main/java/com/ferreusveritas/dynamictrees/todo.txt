[ ]Custom Tree Potions(to replace the confusing vanilla ones):
    [ ]Charcoal Potion(Base for all other tree potions, also cures poison) Awkward potion + Charcoal
    [ ]Potion of Depletion: Depletes soil completely so tree stops growing. Charcoal potion + Slime
    [ ]Potion of Defoliance: Kills tree by destroying it's leaves and leaving it to rot. Charcoal potion + Blue Orchid Flower
    [ ]Potion of Burgeoning: Instantly causes a single growth cycle. Charcoal + Bone
    [ ]Potion of Fertility: Fully fertilizes the soil. Charcoal potion + Raw Fish
    [ ]Potion of Persistence: Freezes the tree by changing all of it's growing leaves blocks with vanilla leaves block and completely depletes the soil.  
        The tree will no longer grow, die in the dark, or drop seeds. Charcoal potion + Lapis Lazuli

Start chunk build:
	Gather any circles in the Yard.
	Mask arcs of circles not in chunk 5 such that the only viable arc is facing zone 5. Half open for zones 2,4,6,8 Quarter open for zones 1,3,7,9
	Mutually mark off arc masks of all adjacent circles
	Are there circles present?
		Y: Proceed to Chain Circles
		N: Proceed to Create first circle


Create First Circle:
	Create Circle at random x, z within stage with radius according to perlin map at coords.
	Proceed to Chain Circles


Chain Circles:
	Unhandled(arc masks not filled) circles exist?
		Y: Pick any circle in the stage and inspect its arc mask.
			Inspect arc mask:
				FILLED: Pick another circle
				EMPTY: New angle is random
				MIXED: New angle is determined by arc mask.
			Proceed to 2nd Circle
		N: Proceed to Circles Complete
	

2nd Circle:
	Create temporary 2nd Circle at new angle from 1st circle on it's tangent with radius according to perlin map at coords.
	Does 2nd Circle intersect with other existing circles?
		Y: Mark intersected circle as 2nd Circle proceed to 3rd Circle
		N: Continue
	Make 2nd circle permanant
	Mutually mark off arc masks on 1st and 2nd circle.
	Proceed to Chain Circles

3rd Circle:
	Create temporary 3rd Circle at tangent to 1st and 2nd circle
	Mark off arc masks on 1st and 2nd circle for 3rd circle
	Does 3rd Circle intersect with other existing circles?
		Y: 3rd circle fails
		N: Make 3rd circle permanant. Mark off arc masks on 3rd circle for 1st and 2nd circle.
	Proceed to Chain Circles

Circles Complete:
